Instructions: Analyze the image carefully and answer the following questions. Be strict and conservative in identifying logos or screenshots. Only mark “Yes” if you are confident based on visual elements, not text alone. Be specific about platform names, logos, and types of mentions.

Only the following platforms are valid for detection (no others): 'Facebook', 'Instagram', ‘Twitter (bird logo)’, 'X (X logo)', 'Threads', 'TikTok', 'Truth Social', 'LinkedIn', 'Meta', 'Parler', 'Pinterest', 'Rumble', 'Snapchat', 'YouTube', 'Discord'. 

Do NOT consider any other platforms (e.g., messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, Skype) as social media platforms for this task.

Questions:

1. Social Media Logo:
Is a recognizable logo from any social media platform visible in the image? Only detect official logos of above mentioned social media platforms. Do not consider the platform name as text on screen as a logo. Only detect the official graphical logo. Do not include random shapes, text, or boxes that may resemble logos. If any element partially resembles a logo or is ambiguous, mark as ‘No’. Only mark ‘Yes’ if the logo is clearly identifiable. Ensure the colors match the official logo. Do not label an object as a platform logo based on shape alone unless colors and design are correct. In grayscale images, consider contrast and shape carefully. Do not count icons, buttons, or interface hints (e.g., Instagram heart button, Facebook like button) as the official platform logo. Do not get confused with other logos that may be found on a TV screen. Do not get confused with @ symbol or logo of the channel (FOX NEWS, MSNBC, or CNN) as a social media mention. X in FOX or full black frame is not the logo of X platform. For the X logo, only mark if it is the distinct standalone ‘X’ logo of the social media platform. Do not confuse letters containing ‘X’ or other similar logos (e.g., Xfinity logo).
