Instructions: Analyze the image carefully and answer the following questions. Be strict and conservative in identifying logos or screenshots. Only mark “Yes” if you are confident based on visual elements, not text alone. Be specific about platform names, logos, and types of mentions.

Only the following platforms are valid for detection (no others): 'Facebook', 'Instagram', ‘Twitter (bird logo)’, 'X (X logo)', 'Threads', 'TikTok', 'Truth Social', 'LinkedIn', 'Meta', 'Parler', 'Pinterest', 'Rumble', 'Snapchat', 'YouTube', 'Discord'. 

Do NOT consider any other platforms (e.g., messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, Skype) as social media platforms for this task.

Questions:

1. Social Media Logo:
Is a recognizable logo from any social media platform visible in the image? Only detect official logos of above mentioned social media platforms. The platform name as text on the provided image is NOT a logo. Only detect the official graphical logo. Do not include random shapes, text, or boxes that may resemble logos. If any element partially resembles a logo or is ambiguous, mark as ‘No’. Only mark ‘Yes’ if the logo is clearly identifiable. Ensure the colors match the official logo. Do not label an object as a platform logo based on shape alone unless colors and design are correct. In grayscale images, consider contrast and shape carefully. Do not count icons, buttons, or interface hints (e.g., Instagram heart button, Facebook like button) as the official platform logo. Do not get confused with other logos that may be found on a TV screen. Do not get confused with @ symbol or logo of the channel (FOX NEWS, MSNBC, or CNN) as a social media mention. 

X Logo Rules (strict):  
- Only mark “Yes” for the exact stylized ‘X’ logo of the social media platform.
- Do NOT get confused by the Xfinity logo which is asymmetric with one arm of X extended. It is NOT the X logo we are interested in.
- Random X letters, X in “FOX”  on the Fox News logo are also NOT the X logo.
- The logo must have the correct sharp design and proportions. If unsure, always answer “No.”
  
(Answer: “Yes” or “No” only)

2. Logo Detection Confidence:
Provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer in Question 1.
- If answer to Question 1 is “Yes”: the confidence score reflects how certain you are that it’s a social media platform logo in the given image.
- If answer to Question 1 is “No”: the confidence score reflects how certain you are that there is no social media platform logo in the given image.
Only provide a number, no extra text. Do not answer as “N/A”.

3. Social Media Logo Type:
If the answer to question 1 is “Yes”, specify which platform(s) they belong to. Do not say “N/A”. For Twitter-related logos, use the following labels: “Twitter (bird logo)” if it’s the bird logo and  “X (X logo)” for the black/white “X” logo. If the answer to question 1 is “No”, answer is “N/A” only.

4. Social Media Post Screenshot:
Does the provided image include a screenshot of a user post from one of the listed social media platforms? A user post screenshot is an image within the provided image that directly captures a social media post made by a platform user (e.g., a Facebook post, tweet on Twitter/X, Instagram post). Do not count screenshots of the platform interface, buttons, menus, or other content that is not an actual user post. Features such as usernames/handles, profile pictures, timestamps, reactions, likes, or platform layout elements can be clues but do not alone guarantee a post screenshot. Simply having the word “post” on screen does not count. Only mark “Yes” if there is clear evidence; do not guess ordinary photos, text, or graphics as posts.
(Answer: “Yes” or “No” only)

5. Screenshot Detection Confidence:
Provide a confidence score between 0 and 1 for your answer in Question 1.
- If answer to Question 1 is “Yes”: the confidence score reflects how certain you are that it’s a social media post screenshot in the given image.
- If answer to Question 1 is “No”: the confidence score reflects how certain you are that there is no social media post screenshot in the given image.
Only provide a number, no extra text. Do not answer as “N/A”.

4. Social Media Screenshot Type:
   If the answer to question 4 is “Yes”,  identify the platform it is from (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Truth Social, etc.). Do not say “N/A”. If the answer to question 3 is “No”, answer “N/A” only.
