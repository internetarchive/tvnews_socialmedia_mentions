Supported Platforms to Consider (not exhaustive): Twitter (bird logo), X (X logo), Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, YouTube, Truth Social, Parler, Rumble, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Discord, Pinterest

If a general mention of “social media” is made without naming a specific platform, indicate that as “General Mention.”

Questions:

1. Social Media Mention:
   Does the image include any reference to social media (either by name, logo, post, or textual mention)? Answer: “Yes” or “No”   
   If the answer is “No”, answer to all the other questions are “N/A”

2. Platform Identification:
   If yes, list all platforms that are mentioned or represented.
   - Use full names (e.g., Twitter, X, Instagram, Truth Social, etc.)
   - If no specific platform is named, but there’s a general reference to social media, answer: “No Platform”

3. Mention Type:
   What kind of reference is it? Select only one of the following:
   - Primary Topic (the social media mention is the primary topic)
   - Supporting Evidence (the social media mention is there to provide supporting evidence to a different story)
   - Call to Action (asking users to engage with the program e.g., "Follow us", "Share your story")
   - Platform Discussion (talking about or analyzing the social media platform itself)
   - General Mention (non-specific or background reference)
   - Passing/Humorous Reference (social media mentioned as a passing comment or humorous reference)

4. Social Media Logo:
   Is a recognizable logo from any social media platform visible in the image?
   (Answer: “Yes” or “No”)

5. Social Media Logo Type:
If the image contains one or more social media platform logos, specify which platform(s) they belong to. Only include official logos of known social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, LinkedIn, etc.). Do not include random shapes, text, or boxes that may resemble logos. Do not get confused with other logos that may be found on a TV screen.
For Twitter-related logos, use the following labels: “Twitter (bird logo)” for the blue bird and  “X (X logo)” for the black/white “X” logo. 

Include all visible logos, even if they are: Partial (cut off or obscured) or Stylized (slightly altered but still clearly recognizable as an official social media logo)

   Does the image include a screenshot of a post from a social media platform?
   (Answer: “Yes” or “No”)

8. Post Context:
   If there is a social media post visible, describe its content or context.
   For example, does it show a reaction, opinion, news update, announcement, trend, humor, or something else?
   Provide a brief summary of what the post conveys. Otherwise, “N/A”

9. Profile Mention:
   Is a specific social media username or profile referenced?
   - If yes, provide the username or profile name as displayed.
