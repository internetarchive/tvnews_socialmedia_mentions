Instructions: Analyze the image carefully and answer the following questions. Be strict and conservative in identifying logos or screenshots. Only mark “Yes” if you are confident based on visual elements, not text alone. Be specific about platform names, logos, and types of mentions.

Supported Platforms to Consider (not exhaustive): Twitter (bird logo), X (X logo), Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, YouTube, Truth Social, Parler, Rumble, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Discord, Pinterest

Questions:

1. Social Media Logo:
   Is a recognizable logo from any social media platform visible in the image? Only detect official logos of known social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, LinkedIn, etc.). Do not include random shapes, text, or boxes that may resemble logos. Do not get confused with other logos that may be found on a TV screen. Do not get confused with @ symbol or logo of the channel (FOX NEWS, MSNBC, or CNN) as a social media mention. X in FOX is not the logo of X platform.   
(Answer: “Yes” or “No” only)

2. Social Media Logo Type:
If the answer to question 1 is “Yes”, specify which platform(s) they belong to. For Twitter-related logos, use the following labels: “Twitter (bird logo)” if it’s the bird logo and  “X (X logo)” for the black/white “X” logo. If the answer to question 1 is “No”, answer “N/A” only.

3. Social Media Post Screenshot:
   Does the image include a screenshot of a post from a social media platform?
   (Answer: “Yes” or “No” only)

4. Social Media Screenshot Type:
   If the answer to question 3 is “Yes”,  identify the platform it is from (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Truth Social, etc.). If the answer to question 3 is “No”, answer “N/A” only.
